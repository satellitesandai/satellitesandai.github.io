        <h1>Exoplanets in 3D Space!</h1>
        <p>
            The interactive plot provides an approach to the understanding of exoplanet discovery by visualizing the spatial relation of discovered exoplanets.
            Each point represents an exoplanet according to its relative position in space. 
            This immersive experience allows to explore exoplanets and gain an understanding how exploration missions allow us to shed light into the cosmos around us.
        <p>View detailed information on each exoplanet by clicking on individual points, which will then appear in the details tab.</p>
        <p>Refine the displayed exoplanet data by applying specific criteria in the filter tab.</p>    
        </p>
